        Migrating to Salesforce isn’t just about moving data—it’s about making the change seamless for your business. We start with <strong>Discovery & Planning</strong>, diving deep into your current systems, data structures, and workflows to map out the best approach for your migration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next comes <strong>Data Cleansing & Preparation</strong>, ensuring the data we move is accurate, organized, and free of duplicates. This step is key to avoiding future headaches and keeping your new system running smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we move into <strong>Migration & Validation</strong>, executing the migration with precision and verifying everything along the way to maintain data integrity. Our goal is zero disruption, so your business keeps moving without hiccups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, during <strong>Go-Live & Post-Migration Support</strong>, we stay by your side, helping your team adjust and ensuring the new system delivers exactly what you need. With our process, Salesforce isn’t just implemented—it’s adopted confidently.
